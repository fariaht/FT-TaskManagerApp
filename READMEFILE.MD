hello!

this is my task manager app. it features a database (SQL/MariaDB) and back-end node.js code built in week 6/7 of this bootcamp.

in week 8, we revisit this code and built a front end in AngularJS, in order to create a mostly function web application. I hope to revisit it with CSS in the future, to make it look nicer, as well as to update it so that you can actually add and update tasks that already exist in the database. this way it would turn into a planner app!
